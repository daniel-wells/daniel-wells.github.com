I am currently investigating applications of statistical learning approaches to meiotic gene expression as part of a DPhil in Genomic Medicine and Statistics at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Jonathan Marchini](https://jmarchini.org) and [Simon Myers](https://myersgroup.github.io).

Previously I completed an integrated masters degree in biochemistry at the University of Oxford during which I gained a broad biological background with research experience in genome engineering, developmental biology, vaccinology, immunology, and oncology.
