I am currently studying for a DPhil in Genomic Medicine and Statistics at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford.

Ultimately, I aim to enable new therapies for disease by discovering their underlying genetic causes.

I also completed my undergraduate and masters education at the University of Oxford during which I gained a broad biological background with research experience in genome engineering, developmental biology, vaccinology, immunology, and oncology.
