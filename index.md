I currently use unsupervised statistical learning approaches to generate new scientific hypotheses and leads from high throughput genomics experiments. This is part of a DPhil in Genomic Medicine and Statistics at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Simon Myers](https://myersgroup.github.io) and [Jonathan Marchini](https://jmarchini.org).

My previous experience covers the 'full stack' of science from designing experiments to generating data as well as analysing the results. This experience spans a broad range of life sciences including oncology, vaccinology, genome engineering, and developmental biology.
